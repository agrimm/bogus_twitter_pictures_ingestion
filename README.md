# Bogus Twitter Pictures Ingestion

You know those twitter accounts dedicated to posting amazing pictures? Yeah, well most of them are bogus. They are often photoshopped, posed, out of context, or lacking proper attribution. http://exposeddc.com/2014/01/28/exposed-interview-paulo-ordoveza-picpedant/

This is part of a project to keep track of what each particular picture tweeting account has done.

This code takes tweets from an account debunking such pictures ([@PicPedant](https://twitter.com/picpedant)), groups them by who it's talking about, and exports the data into a CSV file. This will be imported into a website, not yet created, that will generate pages for each picture tweeting account to indicate what the debunker has said about them.
